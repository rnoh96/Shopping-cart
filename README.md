A simple shopping cart demonstration with minimal styling.

  

## Lessons Learned
In terms of coding techniques, there was not really a hassle in this project. But one thing I learned in this project is that it is very time-saving to plan ahead. When I first started this project, I didn't really put enough time on what functionalities are needed in a shopping cart. Which lead me to repeat adding and removing certain functionalities and ened up spending more time on this project than I expected.



## Deployment
Deployed with Google Firebase.



## Get Started
From command line, first clone this repo:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/rnoh96/Shopping-cart.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd Shopping-cart

# Go into the public folder
$ cd public
```

Once you are in the correct folder:
``` bash
# Open the html file in default browser

# If you are using Windows
$ start index.html

# If you are using Mac OS
$ open index.html
```

You should now see a working webpage.
